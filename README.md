# Machine-learning using python

Libraries used:

NumPy - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

Pandas - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

scikit-learn - Scikit-learn is a  machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

SciPy - SciPy is a open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering. 

Apyori - Apyori is a simple implementation of Apriori algorithm with Python 2.7 and 3.3 - 3.5, provided as APIs and as commandline interfaces. It Consist of only one file and depends on no other libraries, which enable you to use it portably and able to used as APIs.
